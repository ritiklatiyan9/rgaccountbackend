/**
 * Predictive Cash-Flow Forecast.
 *
 * PREDICTIVE model — each future month = a run-rate baseline, raised in any month with a larger KNOWN
 * scheduled due (max, never sum, so the recurring run-rate isn't double-counted):
 *   RUN-RATE  = average monthly ACTUAL cash movement over the last `lookback` months, computed from the
 *               exact same revenue/expense unions the Day Book uses (plot_payments+installment receipts
 *               for inflow; farmer/vendor/commission payments + expenses + day_book EXPENSE for outflow),
 *               so the projection matches the app's own historical numbers.
 *   SCHEDULED = known forward-dated dues that raise a specific month above the baseline:
 *               INFLOW  → pending plot installments (plot_installments.due_date), pending recomputed via
 *                         the app's earmark-aware waterfall (status/paid_amount are stale). Active plots only.
 *               OUTFLOW → open vendor_commitments remaining balance (contract − paid) by due_date.
 *
 * Context figures that have NO reliable due date are reported separately (never fake-bucketed):
 * overdue receivables, overdue / undated vendor commitment balances, and the farmer/land-owner
 * outstanding liability. See migrations 010 (installments), 018 (vendor commitments), 046 (farmers).
